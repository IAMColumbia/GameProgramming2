Game Progrmamming 2 @IAMColumbia

The jeff folder contains all my samples for Design patterns for Game Programming

- mg3.5 Monogame 3.5 and Windows command line samples 
- unity Unity 5.4.x samples I try to include a unity package for each sample

The monogame samples all rely on the MonogameLibrary built in https://github.com/dsp56001/GameProgramming
Some of the Pacman and Ghost samples form this course are encasultaed in the https://github.com/dsp56001/GameProgramming2/tree/master/jeff/mg3.5/MGPacManComponents project this allows wasy access to the components to simplify some the monogame samples

##Command Pattern

The console samples demostrate simple move commands invoked by the console command processor. In monogame this becomes a a game component and in unity this becomes a Monobehaviour. The commands in the console sample are invoked on a fake game component class. In Monogame this becomes a Monogame game component in Unity this is refactored to be a GameObject
